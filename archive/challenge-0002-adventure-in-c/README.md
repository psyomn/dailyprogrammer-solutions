Adventure in C
==============

This is a small project in C that implements a very simple dungeon crawler in
C. This was part of a challenge on /r/dailyprogrammer that can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pjbuj/).

I know there's a few parts that could probably be written a `smarter'. I'm
somewhat of a novice when it comes to C. It will eventually get better.
